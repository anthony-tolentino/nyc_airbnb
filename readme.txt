We looked at AirBnB data from New York City from 2019. We were interested in what we can learn 
about the different areas in NYC that have AirBnB rentals and the average price depending on 
different attributes such as neighborhood, roomy type, and whether the rental was a room or 
entire home/apt. We also looked at how many reviews each room type in each neighborhood 
received.
